1. Solved problems of recursion:

        Understand recursion by print something N times
        
        Print name N times using recursion
        
        Print 1 to N using recursion
        
        Print N to 1 using recursion

        # If print is before recursion fun call, P(4) -> P(3) -> P(2) -> P(1)
        # If print is after recursion fun call,  P(1) -> P(2) -> P(3) -> P(4)

        Sum of first N numbers 

        # time exceeded when pow() used
        # optimized by use of formula //1^3 +2^3 + 3^3 + â€¦.. +n^3 = (n(n+1)/2)^2

        Factorial of N numbers
        
        Reverse an array - can be done using 2 or 1 pointer
        
        Check if a string is palindrome or not
        
        Fibonacci Number

2. Hashing
    integer/character hash array
    Counting frequencies of array elements
    hashing and collision
